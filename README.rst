==================

These are a collection of config files, commonly
referred to as "dotfiles", mainly for the
Linux operating system, but can also be used elswhere in certian
cases, such as cygwin and unix/BSD.

To get my system running how I like it, run setup.sh

Version controlling dotfiles is a great idea, allowing
others to share and use your configurations. Please, however,
be wary of verbatim copying. These settings are tailored toward myself.
