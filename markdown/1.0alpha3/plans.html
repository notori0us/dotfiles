			<h1>Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha3 "Bosco"</h1>
			<p>
				This page was intended to describe plans for the then-upcoming
				release of Bedrock Linux, 1.0alpha3 "Bosco".  Bosco has since
				been released on 2012/12/25.  The following is thus
				out-of-date, but is kept in case anyone is curious.
			</p>
			<h2>Momo's design</h2>
			<p>
				The current release of Bedrock Linux, 1.0alpha2 "Momo", allows
				each chroot'd command to access the other clients via chroots.
				Before it runs a command from a client - in a chroot - the
				relevant mount points (<code>/proc</code>, <code>/sys</code>,
				<code>/home</code>, etc) in that chroot need to be set up.  The
				executables inside of the chroot cannot see outside of the
				chroot, and so for it to run a command from another client the
				chroot needs to see all of the files in the other client.  To
				go from one chrooted client into another client, the new
				chroot/client needs to have its mount points set up as well.
				This ends up creating a tree representing the client history of
				every command, and every node on the tree must be set up.
			</p>
			<p>
				Below you will find is a simple unicode art diagram to
				demonstrate this concept.  If the user were to log in to
				Bedrock, run a shell from Debian, then run Arch's xorg, then
				run Debian's xterm within Arch's xorg, the top most branch of
				the tree below would be followed.  Note that mounts such as
				<code>/proc</code> and <code>/home</code> must each be set up
				about fourty times in the example below.
			</p>

			<p>
				Real-world use of Momo can easily result in hundreds of
				thousands of mount points.  Since it is not possible to predict
				how deep the tree will go, Momo cannot set up all of these
				mounts at boot.  Rather, it attempts to create these mounts
				just before they are necessary on-the-fly.  This has a number
				of down sides:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					There needs to be some way to detect whether or not a node
					on the tree has been set up or needs to be set up.  In
					Momo, this check can easily take over a third of a second
					on relatively powerful hardware.  An experimental branch of
					Momo has managed to significantly reduce this to
					hundredths of a second, although it did so with some
					potentially risky strategies.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a user runs commands differing clients in rapid
					succession (such as in the example describing a potential
					case for the top branch of the unicode art diagram above),
					the background mounting will fall behind and require a very
					noticeable delay.  While this has been reduced in the
					aforementioned experimental branch of Momo, there can
					still be substantial amounts of Bedrock-specific delays in
					common situations.
				</li>
				<li>
					The list of mounts (<code>/proc/mounts</code>) can become
					huge, with hundreds of thousands of lines in real-world
					situations.  This not only causes some RAM overhead, but
					also makes managing non-Bedrock-specific mounts difficult.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is difficult to cleanly remove any given client live as
					the client could be a node through which other clients'
					commands are running.  It is quite possible to disentangle
					a client, but it is not as clean and easy as the Bedrock
					developer would like it to be.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Bosco's design</h2>
			<p>
				The current plan for Bosco is to completely abandon this tree
				structure in favor of a much flatter layout, which should fix
				all of the issues listed above.  Rather that make the files
				from other clients accessible from within any given chrooted
				client, Bosco will allow clients to break out of the chroot
				(and then go back into another chroot) when trying to run a
				command from another client.  The unicode art tree above will
				look like this with Bosco:
			</p>
<pre>
Bedrock
  ↳ Debian ↰   ↰
  ↳ Arch   ↲ ↰ |
  ↳ Bedrock  ↲ ↲</pre>
			<p>
				The number of times each client's mounts have to be set up is
				constant irrelevant of the history of the commands.  All of the
				mounts could be created at boot, and new mounts could easily be
				done if a new client is added to a system live.  This completely
				resolves the first three issues with Momo described above and could
				potentially assist with the fourth.
			</p>
			<h2>Bosco's Implementation</h2>
			<p>
				<code>brc</code> and <code>capchroot</code> will be replaced by
				a C program (which will likely take <code>brc</code>'s name).
				This program will be called whenever a user wishes to run a
				command from other client.  This program will do the following:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Determine (a) which command from (b) which client is
					desired to be run.  This might be done in a similar style
					to how busybox works - it will detect what is desired based
					on how it is called.
				</li>
				<li>
					If it is currently in a chroot, break out of the chroot.
				</li>
				<li>
					Chroot into the client with the desired program
				</li>
				<li>
					Execute the desired command, passing along all of the
					arguments.  Rather than running the command as a child
					process, it might replace itself with the command, akin to
					the Bourne shell's <code>exec</code>.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This command will require two things which typically requires
				root (using chroot and breaking out of a chroot).  If possible,
				rather than being completely setuid'd, the command will use
				Linux capabilities (similar to capchroot).  Moreover, it will
				make several checks to ensure it avoids security issues:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					It will refuse to run if it is not owned by root.
				</li>
				<li>
					It will only chroot into specific directories listed in a
					configuration file with a hard-coded path which must be
					owned by root.
				</li>
				<li>
					It will only run commands from specific directories listed
					in in the aforementioned configuration file.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Rather than having the <code>BRPATH</code> contain many small
				scripts which call <code>brc</code>, it will be structured such
				that a sub-directory for every client which contain symlinks
				(with the name of the executable desired to be run) which point
				the new <code>brc</code>.  <code>brc</code> will detect how it
				was called and run the desired command accordingly.  For
				example:
			</p>
<pre class="file">
/usr/local/brbin/arch/startx     → /opt/bedrock/bin/brc
/usr/local/brbin/bedrock/busybox → /opt/bedrock/bin/brc
/usr/local/brsbin/debian/gparted → /opt/bedrock/bin/brc
</pre>
			<p>
				<code>brp</code> will create this structure, just as it created
				the equivalent structure in Momo.
