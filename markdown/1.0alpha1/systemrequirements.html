			<h1>System requirements for Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha1</h1>
			<p>
				Bedrock Linux itself is quite minimal and will run on very
				limited hardware.  However, the client software Bedrock Linux
				will use will most likely require significantly higher system
				requirements.  See the documentation for the specific client
				distributions you wish to use.

			<h2 id="CPU architecture">CPU architecture</h2>
			<p>
				1.0alpha1 has been tested on (32-bit) x86 and (64-bit) x86-64
				systems.  In theory it should be possible to set it up on
				non-x86 architecture with only minor changes - such as swapping
				out the bootloader - being necessary, but no effort was put
				into ensuring this was an option and no testing was done to
				actually check that this is possible.
			</p>
			<h2 id="CPU Speed">CPU Speed</h2>
			<p>
				1.0alpha1 has been shown to run smoothly on both a 1.6GHz Intel
				Atom and 800MHz Intel Celeron-M (ie, two different ASUS
				EeePCs).  Presumably significantly slower CPUs will also
				suffice.  Remember, though, some client software will likely
				have higher requirements to run adequately.
			</p>
			<h2 id="RAM">RAM</h2>
			<p>
				1.0alpha1 has been shown to run without trouble on 512MB of RAM
				with huge amounts of room to spare.  Much smaller amounts of
				RAM would likely work fine for the core Bedrock Linux software,
				but higher amounts will likely be expected by some client
				software you may choose to run.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Storage">Storage</h2>
			<p>
				Depending on what you choose to compile into the Linux Kernel
				and Busybox, 1.0alpha1 can fit snuggly within only a handful of
				megabytes of disk space (although a fully-loaded Linux Kernel
				can take tens if not hundreds of megabytes).  However, Bedrock
				is nearly useless without any clients, and the clients can take
				quite a bit of space.  See the disk space requirements for the
				client Linux distributions you are interested in.  As a rule of
				thumb, a gigabyte of disk space should be set aside for each
				client distribution, with more being preferable.
