			<h1>Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha2 "Momo" System Requirements</h1>
			<p>
				Note that the system requirements for this release of Bedrock
				Linux (1.0alpha2 "Momo") have not changed from the prior release
				(1.0alpha1 "Appa").
			</p>
			<p>
				Bedrock Linux itself is quite minimal and will run on very
				limited hardware.  However, the client software Bedrock Linux
				will use will most likely require significantly higher system
				requirements.  See the documentation for the specific client
				distributions you wish to use.

			<h2 id="CPU architecture">CPU architecture</h2>
			<p>
				Momo has been tested on (32-bit) x86 and (64-bit)
				x86-64 systems.  In theory it should be possible to set it up
				on non-x86 architecture with only minor changes - such as
				swapping out the bootloader - being necessary, but no effort
				was put into ensuring this was an option and no testing was
				done to actually check that this is possible.
			</p>
			<h2 id="CPU Speed">CPU Speed</h2>
			<p>
				Momo been shown to run smoothly on both a 1.6GHz Intel
				Atom and 800MHz Intel Celeron-M (ie, two different ASUS
				Eee PCs).  Presumably significantly slower CPUs will also
				suffice.  Remember, though, some client software will likely
				have higher requirements to run adequately.
			</p>
			<h2 id="RAM">RAM</h2>
			<p>
				Momo been shown to run without trouble on 512MB of RAM
				with huge amounts of room to spare.  Much smaller amounts of
				RAM would likely work fine for the core Bedrock Linux software,
				but higher amounts will likely be expected by some client
				software you may choose to run.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Storage">Storage</h2>
			<p>
				Depending on what you choose to compile into the Linux Kernel
				and Busybox, Momo fit snuggly within only a handful of
				megabytes of disk space (although a fully-loaded Linux Kernel
				can take tens if not hundreds of megabytes).  However, Bedrock
				is nearly useless without any clients, and the clients can take
				quite a bit of space.  See the disk space requirements for the
				client Linux distributions you are interested in.  As a rule of
				thumb, a gigabyte of disk space should be set aside for each
				client distribution, with more preferred.
