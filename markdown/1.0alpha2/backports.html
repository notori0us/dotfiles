			<h1>Functionality Backported From Bosco</h1>
			<p>
				One of the key features of the upcoming release of Bedrock,
				Bosco, is a much faster brc.  This has been backported to Momo
				for those who would like the performance improvement without
				having to wait for Bosco's release.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this backport has had minimal testing and may be
				potentially problematic.  If you experience problems, rolling
				back to Momo's brc is advisable.
			</p>
			<h2>Benchmarks</h2>
			<p>
				To get an idea of the kind of performance improvement, the time
				to run <code>cat /etc/issue >dev/null</code> was tested "natively" without
				using brc at all (as a control), with the new Bosco brc and
				with the old Momo brc.  The "native" example was run several
				times before running any testing was done to ensure the
				contents of the file being read were already in RAM.
			</p>
			<p>
				On an desktop using a Intel Core i5-3550 (quad core, 3.30Ghz), in a Debian
				squeeze client, the results were as follows:
			</p>
			<ul class="cmd">
				<li>time cat /etc/issue >/dev/null<br>cat /etc/issue > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 0.001 total</li>
				<li>time brc-bosco squeeze cat /etc/issue >/dev/null<br>brc-bosco squeeze cat /etc/issue > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 0.001 total</li>
				<li>time brc-momo squeeze cat /etc/issue >/dev/null<br>brc-momo squeeze cat /etc/issue > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.07s system 14% cpu 0.478 total</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Thus, on that system, Momo's brc causes an almost half-second
				delay.  The backported Bosco's brc's overhead was sufficiently
				small that with <code>time</code>'s resolution was insufficient
				to notice any change between using brc and not using brc at
				all.  Moreover, the CPU utilization for the new brc was, like
				the time it took, below <code>time</code>'s resolution.  Momo's
				brc had a 14% cpu utilization overhead.
			</p>
			<p>
				On an laptop using a Intel Core i3-2310M (dual core,
				hyperthreading, 2.10Ghz), in a Debian squeeze client, the
				results were as follows:
			</p>
			<ul class="cmd">
				<li>time cat /etc/issue >/dev/null<br>cat /etc/issue > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.00s system 46% cpu 0.002 total</li>
				<li>time brc-bosco squeeze cat /etc/issue >/dev/null<br>brc-bosco squeeze cat /etc/issue > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.00s system 53% cpu 0.002 total</li>
				<li>time brc-momo squeeze cat /etc/issue >/dev/null<br>brc-momo squeeze cat /etc/issue > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.07s system 61% cpu 2.025 total</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The results are similar on the slower machine: the new brc has
				a negligible CPU usage and time delay, compared to the very
				noticeable delay caused by Momo's brc.  Quite a noticeable
				improvement.
			</p>
			<h2>Upgrade instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Make a slight change to (the core Bedrock's)
						<code>/etc/init.d/rcS</code> to ensure the mount points
						are set up early, as the new brc will make the
						assumption that they are.  Be careful not to edit a
						client's <code>/etc/init.d/rcS</code> but the core
						Bedrock's: from a client (with a full editor) you can
						probably access this at somewhere such as
						<code>/var/chroot/bedrock/etc/init.d/rcS</code>,
						depending on how you set up your Bedrock Linux install.
					</p>
					<p>
						At line 157 (just above the "DEVICE_MANAGER = "udev" line), add the following:
					</p>
					<pre>announce "Setting up mounts for clients..."
brs
result
</pre>
					<p>
						Then, at the very bottom of the script, remove the if
						block about "$AUTO_BRS" = "1", as it will no longer
						serve any benefit.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Back up the old brc just in case.
					</p>
					<pre class="rcmd">cp /opt/bedrock/bin/brc /opt/bedrock/bin/brc-old</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Download <a
						href="https://raw.github.com/paradigm/bedrocklinux-userland/1.0alpha2/usr/src/brc/brc.c">this
						file</a> somewhere (such as to /usr/src/brc) and cd to that directory.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Run the following to compile the new brc:
					</p>
					<pre class="cmd">gcc brc.c -o brc -static -lcap</pre>
					<p>
						If it complains that you are missing a required library
						(such as sys/capability.h), install the corresponding
						package and try again.  On debian, this package would
						be libcap-dev.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Double-check that the new binary was statically
						compiled.  Ensure ldd tells you "not a dynamic
						executable"
					</p>
					<pre class="rcmd">ldd brc</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you do not already have it, install the package that
						contains the "setcap" command in one of your clients.
						For example, this would be the libcap2-bin package on
						Debian-based systems.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Run a shell, as root, from the client that has the
						setcap command.  You are about to (temporarily) break
						brc, and if you are not already in a root shell which
						has normal access to setcap you may have to fix things
						either with brc-old or falling back to brroot.  Be sure
						to cd to the directory which contains the
						newly-compiled brc.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						In this root shell, move the newly-compiled brc over the old brc.
					</p>
					<pre class="rcmd">cp brc /opt/bedrock/bin/brc</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Set the cap_sys_chroot capability (both effective and permitted, but not inherited):
					</p>
					<pre class="rcmd">setcap cap_sys_chroot=ep /opt/bedrock/bin/brc</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						At this point, you should be good to go.  You probably
						don't have to reboot or do anything to tell the system
						about the new brc.  For kicks, perhaps benchmark it.
						Run a shell in a client of your choice, then run
						(changing "client" below to the client the shell is in,
						such that the brc command is running the exact same
						version of cat on the exact same file):
					</p>
					<ul class="cmd">
						<li>time cat /etc/issue >/dev/null</li>
						<li>time brc <code class="changethis">client</code> cat /etc/issue >/dev/null</li>
						<li>time brc-old <code class="changethis">client</code> cat /etc/issue >/dev/null</li>
					</u>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</ul>
			<h2>Rolling back the backport</h2>
				If you have trouble with the backported brc and would like to
				roll it back, it is quite easy to do.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							First, get to a root prompt.  brroot should be
							resilient against whatever problems the new brc could
							cause, and on the off chance even that is insufficient,
							boot a Live distro and mount the filesystem.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Copy the backup brc over the new one
						</p>
						<pre class="rcmd">cp /opt/bedrock/bin/brc-old /opt/bedrock/bin/brc</pre>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The alterations to the init script should be safe
							to keep, as the worst they can do is slightly slow
							down your boot time.  If you would like to revert
							them irrelevant, with your text editor of choice,
							go to line 157 of <code>/etc/init.d/rcS</code> in
							the core Bedrock and delete the three lines you
							created in step one of the upgrade instructions
							("Setting up mounts for clients...").  Then, to the
							bottom of the file, append:
						</p>
						<pre>if [ "$AUTO_BRS" = "1" ]
then
	announce "Running brs (background)..."
	brs &
	result
fi</pre>
					</li>
					<li>
						At this point, you should be good to go.  You probably
						do not have to reboot, but it would be advisable here
						just in case.
					</li>
				</ol>
